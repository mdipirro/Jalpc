Nowadays, most programmers do have their own blog to talk about their work. Usually, their posts contain useful guides about a wide variety of topics. They speak about their findings, publish insights and novelties about the programming language(s) they use most and trace a path that sometimes leads to *de facto* best practices. Such guides, together with StackOverflow, have been handy tools for many other programmers. That is, ultimately, the essence of modern programming: taking advantage of the wide knowledge that's out there, using it as a building block to improve ourselves and our software.

Long story short, I ended up asking myself whether I could be part of this great community, publishing posts and guides to help others solve issues I already fought against. And, well, the answer was **yes**. Or, at least, I'll try to honor this purpose.

I'm actually planning on using this blog as a kind of personal diary, a way to keep trace of things I do or find out at work or in my spare time. Hence, you won't find posts about a specific topic of programming language here. You'll most likely find posts about inhomogeneous topics, potentially ranging from Docker to Scala. 

So I guess it's time to introduce myself. I'm Matteo, a software engineer that enjoys programming and working with software at all levels. I focused my academic path on formal methods and type systems, studying and formalizing type safety statements for programming languages. When I entered industry, I happened to work with embedded systems and applications deployments, ranging my daily tasks from low level to web programming, from Docker images specifications to charts configuration for Kubernetes deployments. I also restarted my journey into functional programming, using my previous knowledge of Haskell to dive into category theory and Scala.

I'll try to talk about all of this in this blog, writing (possibly useful) things whenever I fall into them.

That's all for now. See you soon!
